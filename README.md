# Lora-Based-chatbot
This project demonstrates a private chatbot communication system built using LoRa (REYAX RYLR896) transceiver modules, with one module connected to an ESP32 and another to an ESP8266. The setup enables long-range, low-power, peer-to-peer communication without the need for Wi-Fi or the internet.
